        From the glossy lakes of Minnesota, to the endless mountains in the Pacific Northwest, the United States of America has it all. We are so thankful to call the “Land of the Free” our home. And though we might be biased, we believe it’s a country that deserves to be explored by foreigners and nationals alike. 
</p><p className="bg-black bg-opacity-50 p-4">
Most people travel to the US for a short vacation and end up hitting one or two cities, but there is so much more to be discovered here! Each state is unique and has something special to offer, from the national parks to the streets of New Orleans, our country boasts a diversity of geography, culture, food and experiences that travelers would be hard pressed to find anywhere else.

One of the best ways to see this massive country (and our personal favorite method of travel!) is to take a road trip. Come along with us as we share our USA travel tips, road trip advice, and vanlife stories.
